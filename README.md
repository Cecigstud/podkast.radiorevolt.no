# Podcast feed generator for Radio Revolt #

Generate podcast feeds that can act as drop-in replacement for the existing podcast feeds, and work well with podcast apps.

The main goal is to **eliminate the need for Feedburner**, since Google might shut it down whenever they feel like it.


## Features ##

* **Use metadata** like episode title, description, image and link from dusken.no/radio and radiorevolt.no (using podcast date to decide which one to use)
* Use metadata like feed title, description and image from dusken.no/radio or radiorevolt.no (whichever is in use)
* Only publish a podcast episode if its corresponding episode post on dusken.no/radio or radiorevolt.no is published (enabling **preproduction of podcasts**)
* Follow the **guidelines set by iTunes** so that the feed can be used directly by it.
* **Preserve** existing episodes the way they are.


## Technologies ##

This project uses Python v3.4 only, and is written so that the podcast feeds can be updated regularly (by something like
 a cron job) or generated afresh each time a feed is accessed (potentially with a cache).


## How to set up ##

1. [Use virtualenv!](https://iamzed.com/2009/05/07/a-primer-on-virtualenv/)
2. Install the following packages (assuming Ubuntu/Debian):

    * libxml2
    * libxml2-dev
    * libxslt1.1
    * libxslt1-dev
    * python3-lxml

3. Install build dependencies for python and its lxml-bindings by running `sudo apt-get build-dep python3-lxml` (still assuming Ubuntu/Debian)

4. Install dependencies by running one of the two commands below. You must decide if you want to run a Python web server for serving freshly generated podcast feeds, or generate podcast feeds periodically and serve the generated feeds with some other HTTP server.
    <dl>
        <dt>Run web-server and generate feeds on-the-fly</dt>
        <dd><code>pip install -r webserver/requirements.txt</code></dd>
        <dt>Generate feeds periodically</dt>
        <dd><code>pip install -r generator/requirements.txt</code></dd>
    </dl>

5. Copy `generator/settings_template.py` to `generator/settings.py` and fill in settings.
6. Do the same with `webserver/settings_template.py` if you intend to use the provided web server.

TODO: Correct the use of term `web server`, since what we're really making is something that can be run _by_ a
web server.


## Scripts ##

<dl>
    <dt>generator/generate_feed.py</dt>
    <dd>Generate RSS feed for a single podcast.</dd>
    <dt>generator/batch_generate_feed.py</dt>
    <dd>Generate RSS feeds for all known podcasts.</dd>
    <dt>webserver/server.py</dt>
    <dd>Run web server which generates podcast feeds as they're requested.</dd>
</dl>

Use the `--help` flag to see available options for any script.

## Details: How it works ##

### Generating the feed for a podcast ###

First, episodes for this podcast are fetched. The `episode_source` is responsible for this.
It also writes basic metadata for all episodes.

Secondly, `metadata_sources` may act on a subset of the episodes and add or overwrite the existing metadata with new data.
Each metadata source has a method for figuring out if this is a relevant episode for this source. If it is, then the
metadata source is asked to edit the XML item for that episode.

**Only one** metadata source may supply metadata for any given episode. The first one that is deemed relevant for an
episode is the one that is chosen. The order in which the metadata sources appear in
`generator/metadata_sources/__init__.py` is thus of big importance.

Note that it is perfectly acceptable for no metadata source to match an episode â€“ in such cases, the default metadata
from the `episode_source` is used.
